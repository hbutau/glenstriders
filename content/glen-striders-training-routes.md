## Route Analysis: Two Paths to Excellence

Glen Striders utilizes two primary training routes, each designed to develop different aspects of running fitness. The Amalinda-Fidelity Route offers endurance-building distance, while the Trabablas 10K provides varied terrain perfect for speed and strength work.

### Route 1: Amalinda-Fidelity Route

This route takes runners through the scenic areas of Glen View and Glen Norah, with rolling hills that challenge without overwhelming. The moderate 104-meter elevation gain is distributed across the distance, making it ideal for maintaining steady aerobic effort. The route passes through South View Park, offering pleasant scenery and varied terrain that keeps the run engaging from start to finish.

### Route 2: Glen Striders Trabablas 10K

## Training Recommendations

### For Maximum Training Benefit:

**Marathon Preparation:** Use the Amalinda-Fidelity Route as your primary long run (once per week), building from 13km to 21km and beyond. The moderate, rolling terrain perfectly simulates race conditions and builds the aerobic endurance needed for 42.2km.

**10K Race Training:** The Trabablas 10K is your perfect race-pace simulator. Use this route for tempo runs at your goal pace, or break it into intervals using the distinct segments as natural work zones.

**Weekly Training Mix:** Alternate between routes throughout the week. Use Trabablas for Tuesday speed sessions and the Amalinda route for Saturday long runs. This combination builds both speed and endurance while preventing monotony.

**Hill Training:** Both routes offer excellent hill work. The Highglen House School Climb on the Trabablas route is perfect for hill repeats, while the rolling nature of Amalinda-Fidelity builds strength without overwhelming beginners.

## Why These Routes Work for Glen Striders

**Scientific Training Principles:** The combination of these two routes covers all essential training zones. The Amalinda-Fidelity Route develops your aerobic system through sustained effort, while Trabablas provides the variety needed for lactate threshold and VO2 max development.

**Local Terrain Advantage:** Both routes utilize Harare's natural topography. Rather than flat, monotonous running, these routes build real-world strength that translates directly to race performance – especially important for events like the Old Mutual Harare Marathon which features similar terrain.

**Community Building:** When you run these routes with Glen Striders, you're never alone. Group training is scientifically proven to improve performance, increase consistency, and make hard efforts feel easier. The supportive atmosphere of club runs transforms challenging workouts into enjoyable shared experiences.

**Accessibility:** Both routes are classified as 'Easy' difficulty, making them accessible to runners of all levels. Whether you're preparing for your first 5K or your tenth marathon, these routes scale to your fitness level.
