At Glen Striders, we believe running isn't just about the kilometers and pounding the pavements – it's about the connections, the shared journey, and the incredible community we build together. That's why we're thrilled to announce a brand-new initiative designed to inject even more fun into our club activities: The Glen Striders Duathlon Series!

### What is a Glen Striders Duathlon?

Forget the traditional swim-bike-run! Our Duathlon is all about celebrating the joy of running, then seamlessly transitioning into a fun, low-cost social activity. It's our way of extending the camaraderie beyond the final stride, creating memorable experiences and stronger bonds within our running family. Each event will have a unique "Run To..." theme!

We know that after a good run, there's nothing better than unwinding with friends, making new connections, and enjoying great food together. Our aim is to offer these moments without anyone feeling a pinch in their pocket. From post-run pizza gatherings to scenic coffee mornings, we'll be exploring a variety of exciting options.

### Kicking Off with "Run To Pizza": Our Slice & Sprint Event!

We're incredibly excited to launch our series with everyone's favorite: the "Run To Pizza"! Here's what makes this event special – we'll actually run TO the pizza shop as our destination! Imagine the fun of running together with your fellow Striders, arriving at the pizza shop with the endorphins flowing, enjoying delicious pizza right there, and capturing the moment with great photos!
