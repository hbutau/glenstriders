At Glen Striders, we believe running isn't just about the kilometers and pounding the pavements – it's about the connections, the shared journey, and the incredible community we build together. That's why we're thrilled to announce a brand-new initiative designed to inject even more fun into our club activities: The Glen Striders Duathlon Series!

### What is a Glen Striders Duathlon?

Our Duathlon is all about celebrating the joy of running, then seamlessly transitioning into a fun, low-cost social activity. It's our way of extending the camaraderie beyond the final stride, creating memorable experiences and stronger bonds within our running family. Each event will have a unique "Run To..." theme!

We know that after a good run, there's nothing better than unwinding with friends, making new connections, and enjoying great food together. Our aim is to offer these moments without anyone feeling a pinch in their pocket. From post-run pizza gatherings to scenic coffee mornings, we'll be exploring a variety of exciting options.

### Kicking Off with "Run To Pizza": Our Slice & Sprint Event!

We're incredibly excited to launch our series with everyone's favorite: the "Run To Pizza"! Here's what makes this event special – we'll actually run TO the pizza shop as our destination! Imagine the fun of running together with your fellow Striders, arriving at the pizza shop with the endorphins flowing, enjoying delicious pizza right there, and capturing the moment with great photos!

Run Route: We'll run from OK Makomva directly to Pizza Shop – the pizza shop is our destination!

At the Pizza Shop: Once we arrive, we'll enjoy pizza together, share stories, and take fun group photos to capture the memories!

### Participation Details:
To keep this event accessible and fun for everyone, we're organizing a great pizza gathering right at the pizza shop!

What to bring: Just bring yourself, your appetite, and maybe your phone or camera for photos! We'll have delicious pizza for everyone to enjoy together at the shop.

What the Club provides: We'll organize the pizza and refreshments at the shop location, so all you need to bring is your good cheer, running spirit, and a smile for the photos!

This is the perfect opportunity to meet new members, catch up with old friends, capture fun memories with photos, and create lasting bonds. Whether you're a seasoned ultra-runner or just starting your running journey, all Glen Striders are welcome!

Keep an eye on our website and social media for announcements about future "Run To..." Duathlon events, including "Run To Coffee," "Run To braai," and more!

Let's make our runs even more rewarding. See you on the road and at the pizza party!
